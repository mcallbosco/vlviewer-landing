## Other Milestones

There's now official transcripts for around 60% of the voicelines in the game. So, the website is much more accurate now. It has also allowed me to add other localizations to the website (In transcript only form for now, until dubs are added to the game. I plan to support all dubs as soon as they are added.)

One of the Deadlock Devs linked to my website in the discord! Kaori, if you are here, hi!

I received my first Kofi donation related to the VLViewer. Beyza, if you are reading this, thank you again.

## The Future

If you have read this far, thank you. I am very hungry for suggestions for features and anything else related to the website, so if you have any ideas or suggestions for changes I should make, please feel free to post in the [VLViewer thread on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1231286446472691825/1410736031598121102), and @ me (@Mcall). I don't have any major updates to the website planned at this point, but your suggestions could help change that. I do plan to push new content ASAP when it comes out however, so hopefully you should see those types of updates the same day new content is released. 

The current approach to transcript localizations is experimental and subject to change. My assumption is that most users will autotranslate the web UI, which means the English voiceline text will get autotranslated and be displayed alongside the official transcript translations for lines that have them. This is why I added the flag to each line, and the option to hide the base english transcriptions if desired. If applicable, I'd like to hear what you think about the current setup and how it could be improved. 

VlViewer will always remain ad free, and I have no plans to monitize.
