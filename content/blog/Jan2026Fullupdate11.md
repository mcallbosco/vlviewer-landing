There are a ton of new voicelines for exsisting characters. The voicelines for the new characters will be added on the days that they drop, hopefully within the hour! In total, there was around 4,000 voicelines added.


Also, I added leaderboard for voiceline correction contributors! A big thanks to everyone who has submitted corrections! [https://vlviewer.com/contributors](https://vlviewer.com/contributors)
