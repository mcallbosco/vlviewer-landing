There's a few shopkeeper lines for the upcoming characters!. If you want to listen through all of them, go to [https://deadlock.vlviewer.com/voicelines/](https://deadlock.vlviewer.com/voicelines/) and click play all. By default it should sort by new. If not, sort by new and then play all.

Also, I added leaderboard for voiceline correction contributors! A big thanks to everyone who has submitted corrections! [https://vlviewer.com/contributors](https://vlviewer.com/contributors)
