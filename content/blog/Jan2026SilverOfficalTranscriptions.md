Silver is here!

If you can't see them or the new voicelines, (they should be at the top of the homepage) you might have to clear your browsers cache. You can do this by right clicking the refresh button, or clearing your browser data on Chrome.


A big thanks to all of the contributors to the transcript project over the last 6 months, I appreciate each and every contribution. Hopefully there should be less manual corrections required now. [https://vlviewer.com/contributors](https://vlviewer.com/contributors)


When characters drop, I will aim to have the content on the website uploaded within 60 minutes (Assuming Valve does the drop at 5pm est).


By the way, did you know the VLViewer covers over 97% of all the voice files in the game? You can view which ones are missed at [https://deadlock.vlviewer.com/coverage/](https://deadlock.vlviewer.com/coverage/). The missed ones are due to weird file names and being old test files that do not have relevance to the current game.
