Recently, Deadlock added a file with english and chineese transcriptions to the game. You can see it for yourself if you open your game files and navigate to Deadlock\game\citadel\resource\localization\citadel_generated_vo. You can even see transcriptions for the upcoming character's voicelines! (However, I wont be publishing them to the website until the voiceline files are added, since it seems like an oversite, given that the audio files were removed). While it covers most audio files, it doesn't cover all, so Speach to Text software will still be used for voicelines without a transcription. You can tell if a transcription is offical or not by the presence of the edit button. 

A big thanks to all of the contributors to the transcript project over the last 6 months, I appreciate each and every contribution. Hopefully there should be less manual corrections required now. [https://vlviewer.com/contributors](https://vlviewer.com/contributors)

When characters drop, I will aim to have the content on the website uploaded within 30 minutes (Assuming valve does the drop at 5pm est).
