Recently, Deadlock added a file with english and chinese transcriptions to the game. You can see it for yourself if you open your game files and navigate to Deadlock\game\citadel\resource\localization\citadel_generated_vo. You can even see transcriptions for the upcoming character's voicelines! (However, I wont be publishing them to the website until the voiceline files are added, since it seems like an oversite, given that the audio files were removed). While it covers most audio files, it doesn't cover all, so Speech to Text software will still be used for voicelines without a transcription. You can tell if a transcription is official or not by the presence of the edit button.


A big thanks to all of the contributors to the transcript project over the last 6 months, I appreciate each and every contribution. Hopefully there should be less manual corrections required now. [https://vlviewer.com/contributors](https://vlviewer.com/contributors)


When characters drop, I will aim to have the content on the website uploaded within 30 minutes (Assuming valve does the drop at 5pm est).


By the way, did you know the VLViewer covers over 97% of all the voice files in the game? You can view which ones are missed at [https://deadlock.vlviewer.com/coverage/](https://deadlock.vlviewer.com/coverage/). The missed ones are due to weird file names and being old test files that do not have relevance to the current game.
